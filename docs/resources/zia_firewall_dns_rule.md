# Resource: zia_firewall_dns_rule

The **zia_firewall_dns_rule** resource allows the creation and management of ZIA Cloud Firewall DNS rules in the Zscaler Internet Access.

**NOTE 1** Zscaler Cloud Firewall DNS Rules contain default and predefined rules which are placed in their respective orders. These rules `CANNOT` be deleted. When configuring your rules make sure that the `order` attributue value consider these pre-existing rules so that Terraform can place the new rules in the correct position, and drifts can be avoided. i.e If there are 2 pre-existing rules, you should start your rule order at `3` and manage your rule sets from that number onwards. The provider will reorder the rules automatically while ignoring the order of pre-existing rules, as the API will be responsible for moving these rules to their respective positions as API calls are made.

The most common default and predefined rules:

|              Rule Names                      |  Default or Predefined   |   Rule Number Associated |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
|  `Office 365 One Click Rule`                 |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `ZPA Resolver for Road Warrior`             |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `Critical risk DNS categories`              |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `Critical risk DNS tunnels`                 |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `High risk DNS categories`                  |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `High risk DNS tunnels`                     |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `Risky DNS categories`                      |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `Risky DNS Risky DNS tunnels`               |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `Unknown DNS Traffic`                       |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `Default Firewall DNS Rule`                 |      `Predefined`       |           `Yes`          |
|  `ZPA Resolver for Locations`                |        `Default`        |           `No`           |
|  `Fallback ZPA Resolver for Locations`       |        `Default`        |           `No`           |
|  `Fallback ZPA Resolver for Road Warrior`    |        `Default`        |           `No`           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|

**NOTE 2** Certain attributes on `predefined` rules can still be managed or updated via Terraform such as:

- `description` - (Optional) Enter additional notes or information. The description cannot exceed 10,240 characters.
- `state` - (Optional) An enabled rule is actively enforced. A disabled rule is not actively enforced but does not lose its place in the Rule Order. The service skips it and moves to
- `labels` (list) - Labels that are applicable to the rule.
      - `id` - (Integer) Identifier that uniquely identifies an entity

**NOTE 3** The import of `predefined` rules is still possible in case you want o have them under the Terraform management; however, remember that these rules cannot be deleted. That means, the provider will fail when executing `terraform destroy`; hence, you must remove the rules you want to delete, and re-run `terraform apply` instead.

## Example Usage - Create Firewall DNS Rules - Redirect Action

```hcl
data "zia_department_management" "engineering" {
 name = "Engineering"
}

data "zia_group_management" "normal_internet" {
    name = "Normal_Internet"

data "zia_firewall_filtering_time_window" "work_hours" {
    name = "Work hours"
}

resource "zia_firewall_dns_rule" "this" {
    name = "Example_DNS_Rule01"
    description = "Example_DNS_Rule01"
    action = "REDIR_REQ"
    state = "ENABLED"
    order = 10
    rank = 7
    redirect_ip = "8.8.8.8"
    dest_countries = ["CA", "US"]
    source_countries = ["CA", "US"]
    protocols = ["ANY_RULE"]
    departments {
        id = [ data.zia_department_management.engineering.id ]
    }
    groups {
        id = [ data.zia_group_management.normal_internet.id ]
    }
