# zia_location_management (Resource)

* [Official documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zia/about-locations)
* [API documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zia/location-management#/locations-get)

The **zia_location_management** resource allows the creation and management of ZIA locations in the Zscaler Internet Access. This resource can then be associated with a:

* Static IP resource
* GRE Tunnel resource
* VPN credentials resource
* URL filtering and firewall filtering rules

## Example Usage - Location Management with UFQDN VPN Credential

```hcl

## Import

Zscaler offers a dedicated tool called Zscaler-Terraformer to allow the automated import of ZIA configurations into Terraform-compliant HashiCorp Configuration Language.
[Visit](https://github.com/zscaler/zscaler-terraformer)

**zia_location_management** can be imported by using `<LOCATION_ID>` or `<LOCATION_NAME>` as the import ID.

For example:

```shell
terraform import zia_location_management.example <location_id>
```

or

```shell
terraform import zia_location_management.example <location_name>
```
