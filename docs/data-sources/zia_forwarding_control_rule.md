# Data Source: zia_forwarding_control_rule

Use the **zia_forwarding_control_rule** data source to get information about a forwarding control rule which is used to forward selective Zscaler traffic to specific destinations based on your needs.For example, if you want to forward specific web traffic to a third-party proxy service or if you want to forward source IP anchored application traffic to a specific Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) App Connector or internal application traffic through ZIA threat and data protection engines, use forwarding control by configuring appropriate rules.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# ZIA Forwarding Control - ZPA Gateway
data "zia_forwarding_control_rule" "this" {
  name = "FWD_RULE01"
}
```
