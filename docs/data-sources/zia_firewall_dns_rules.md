# Data Source: zia_firewall_dns_rules

Use the **zia_firewall_dns_rules** data source to get information about a cloud firewall DNS rule available in the Zscaler Internet Access.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# ZIA Firewall DNS Rule by name
data "zia_firewall_dns_rules" "this" {
    name = "Default Cloud IPS Rule"
}
```

```hcl
# ZIA Firewall DNS Rule by ID
data "zia_firewall_dns_rules" "this" {
    id = "12365478"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the Firewall Filtering policy rule
* `id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the Firewall Filtering policy rule

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `description` - (String) Enter additional notes or information. The description cannot exceed 10,240 characters.
* `order` - (Integer) Policy rules are evaluated in ascending numerical order (Rule 1 before Rule 2, and so on), and the Rule Order reflects this rule's place in the order.
* `state` - (String) An enabled rule is actively enforced. A disabled rule is not actively enforced but does not lose its place in the Rule Order. The service skips it and moves to the next rule.
* `action` - (String) The action configured for the rule that must take place if the traffic matches the rule criteria, such as allowing or blocking the traffic or bypassing the rule.
