## Examples Usage

```hcl
# Configure the Zscaler Internet Access Provider
terraform {
    required_providers {
        zia = {
            version = "1.0.0"
            source = "zscaler.com/zia/zia"
        }
    }
}

provider "zia" {}
```

```hcl
# Create a location management resource
resource "zia_location_management" "gre_canada_toronto_branch01"{
    name = "GRE Canada - Toronto - Branch01"
    description = "GRE Canada - Toronto - Branch01"
    country = "CANADA"
    tz = "CANADA_AMERICA_TORONTO"
    ip_addresses = [ zia_traffic_forwarding_static_ip.gre_ca_toronto_branch01.ip_address ]
    depends_on = [ zia_traffic_forwarding_static_ip.gre_ca_toronto_branch01 ]
}
```

```hcl
# Create GRE Tunnel
resource "zia_traffic_forwarding_gre_tunnel" "gre_ca_toronto_branch01" {
  source_ip = zia_traffic_forwarding_static_ip.gre_ca_toronto_branch01.ip_address
  comment   = "GRE Canada - Toronto - Branch01"
  within_country = true
  country_code = "CA"
  ip_unnumbered = false
  depends_on = [ zia_traffic_forwarding_static_ip.gre_ca_toronto_branch01 ]
}
```

```hcl
# Create Static IP Address
resource "zia_traffic_forwarding_static_ip" "gre_ca_toronto_branch01"{
    ip_address =  "xx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
    routable_ip = true
    comment = "GRE Canada - Toronto - Branch01"
    geo_override = false
}
```

## Authentication

The ZIA provider offers various means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported:

* Static credentials
* Environment variables

### Static credentials

⚠️ **WARNING:** Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file be committed to public version control

Static credentials can be provided by specifying the `username`, `password`, `api_key`, `zia_cloud` arguments in-line in the ZIA provider block:

**Usage:**

```hcl
provider "zia" {
  username      = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  password      = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  api_key       = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  zia_cloud  = '<zscaler_cloud_name>'
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide credentials via the `ZIA_USERNAME`, `ZIA_PASSWORD`, `ZIA_API_KEY`, `ZIA_CLOUD` environment variables, representing your ZIA username, password, API Key credentials and tenant base URL, respectively.

```hcl
provider "zia" {}
```

**Usage:**

```sh
export ZIA_USERNAME = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export ZIA_PASSWORD = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export ZIA_API_KEY  = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export ZIA_CLOUD = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
terraform plan
```

If you are on Windows, use PowerShell to set the environmenr variables using the following commands:

```sh
$env:username = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
$env:password = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
$env:api_key = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
$env:zia_cloud = '<zscaler_cloud_name>'
```

For details about how to retrieve your tenant Base URL and API key/token refer to the Zscaler help portal. <https://help.zscaler.com/zia/getting-started-zia-api>
